# API Resilience Improvements

## Problem Solved
The server was experiencing repeated 503 "no healthy upstream" errors from the Groq API, causing recommendation failures.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
- **Max Retries**: 3 attempts
- **Base Delay**: 1 second
- **Backoff Strategy**: Exponential (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **Fallback**: Smart recommendations when all retries fail

### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- **Failure Threshold**: 3 consecutive failures
- **Reset Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **States**: CLOSED (healthy), OPEN (disabled), HALF_OPEN (testing)
- **Protection**: Prevents overwhelming the API during outages

### 3. Smart Fallback System
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Based on user context, cart items, and preferences
- **Graceful Degradation**: Users still get relevant recommendations
- **Multiple Fallback Levels**: AI parsing errors, API failures, circuit breaker activation

### 4. Enhanced Monitoring
- **Health Endpoint**: `/health` - Shows circuit breaker status
- **Status Endpoint**: `/api/status` - Detailed API health monitoring
- **Real-time Metrics**: Failure counts, timing, next retry estimates

## API Endpoints

### Health Check
```bash
curlhttps://drip-backend-iota.vercel.app/health
```

### Detailed Status
```bash
curlhttps://drip-backend-iota.vercel.app/api/status
```

## Circuit Breaker States

- **CLOSED**: Normal operation, API calls allowed
- **OPEN**: API temporarily disabled due to failures
- **HALF_OPEN**: Testing if API has recovered

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: System continues working during API outages
2. **Better User Experience**: Always provides recommendations
3. **Resource Protection**: Prevents API rate limiting and cascading failures
4. **Observability**: Clear visibility into system health
5. **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing when API service recovers

## Configuration

- Circuit breaker failure threshold: 3 failures
- Circuit breaker reset timeout: 30 seconds
- Retry attempts: 3 with exponential backoff
- Smart fallback always available
